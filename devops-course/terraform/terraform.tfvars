# Setup-DevOps-Environment.ps1 populated the password in the appropriate environment variable (TF_VAR_db_password) during assignment #1

# --- How Terraform resolves variable values ---
# 1. -var flag on CLI (highest priority)
# 2. terraform.tfvars (this file)
# 3. default in variables.tf (lowest)

# These values feed into resources via:
#   var.aws_region
#   var.az
#   var.db_instance_type
